# Session Summary and Next Steps

This document summarizes the session on building and debugging the flight ticket scraper and outlines potential next steps.

## Session Summary

*   **Goal**: The primary goal of the session was to build a web scraper to extract flight ticket information from the tour.ne.jp website.

*   **Key Components**:
    *   `scraper.py`: The main script that uses Selenium to control a headless Chrome browser and scrape the website.
    *   `parser.py`: A module containing the logic to parse the HTML and extract the flight data.
    *   `test_parse.py`: A utility script to test the parsing logic offline on a saved HTML file (`debug.html`).

*   **Challenges Faced**:
    *   The main challenge was debugging the parser (`parser.py`). The initial selectors were failing because of a misunderstanding of the website's complex and dynamic HTML structure.
    *   The `clean_html` function, intended to simplify the HTML, was initially too aggressive and removed essential attributes, which further complicated the debugging process.

*   **Resolution Process**:
    *   The problem was resolved through an iterative process of inspecting the `debug.html` file to understand the correct HTML structure.
    *   The `clean_html` function was simplified to preserve necessary attributes (`class` and `id`).
    *   The `parse_flight_data` function was rewritten with the correct CSS selectors based on the actual structure of the flight data containers.

*   **Final State**: The parser is now working correctly and can successfully extract all the required fields for each flight offer, including provider name, price, trip type, schedule, duration, and transfers.

## Next Steps

With the parser now working, the following next steps can be taken:

1.  **Run the Main Scraper**: Execute the main `scraper.py` script to collect flight data for all the configured destinations and dates.

2.  **Review Collected Data**: Check the output files in the `data/` directory to ensure the data is being saved correctly.

3.  **Enhance the Scraper**: Consider adding more features to the scraper, such as:
    *   **Handling Different Trip Types**: Extend the scraper to handle round trips and multi-city flights, in addition to the current one-way functionality.
    *   **Structured Data Storage**: Instead of saving the data in Markdown files, store it in a more structured format like CSV, JSONL, or a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for easier analysis.
    *   **Improved Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling and logging to make the scraper more reliable.
    *   **Scheduled Execution**: Set up a scheduler (e.g., using cron jobs) to run the scraper periodically and collect data over time.
