# Summary of Work on Air Ticket Scraper

This document summarizes the work done to debug and fix the flight ticket information scraper.

## 1. Initial Problem

The parser was initially failing with `NoneType` errors. This indicated that the CSS selectors used to extract flight information were not finding the corresponding elements in the HTML source of the page.

## 2. Debugging Process

The debugging process involved several steps to identify and resolve the issue:

1.  **Code Modularization**: The parsing logic was isolated into a separate `parser.py` file, and a `test_parse.py` script was created to allow for offline testing on a `debug.html` file, which contained the HTML source of the scraped page.

2.  **HTML Cleaning Analysis**: I initially suspected that the `clean_html` function was too aggressive and was removing necessary HTML attributes. I experimented with modifying this function to preserve `class` attributes.

3.  **HTML Structure Misunderstanding**: After several failed attempts, I realized that my fundamental understanding of the page's HTML structure was incorrect. The CSS selector `div[id^="Area_price"]` was targeting a `div` containing only a price table, not the main container for all flight information.

4.  **In-depth HTML Inspection**: To get a correct understanding of the structure, I inspected the `debug.html` file in detail. By reading larger chunks of the file, I was able to identify the correct container for each flight offer and the correct class names for the different data points.

## 3. Solution

Based on the insights from the debugging process, I implemented the following solution:

1.  **Corrected Parser Logic**: I completely rewrote the `parse_flight_data` function in `parser.py` to use the correct CSS class names for each piece of information to be extracted, including provider name, price, trip type, schedule details, duration, and number of transfers.

2.  **Defensive Selectors**: The new selectors were made more defensive with additional checks to handle cases where elements might be missing, preventing the parser from crashing.

3.  **Robust HTML Cleaning**: The `clean_html` function was updated to remove unnecessary attributes while preserving `id` and `class` attributes, which are essential for the parser to work correctly.

## 4. Final Result

The parser is now fully functional and successfully extracts all the required flight information from the scraped HTML page. The `test_parse.py` script confirms that the parser correctly processes the `debug.html` file and outputs the structured flight data as expected.
