# Session Summary: 2025-10-03

This document summarizes the work completed during this session for the AI Air Ticket Search Agent project.

## 1. Initial Specification and Refinement

The session began with an initial project specification (`spec.md`). The first task was to refine this specification based on new requirements:

- **Configuration**: The agent's configuration was shifted from command-line arguments to file-based settings.
- **Parameters**: The search parameters were updated to support multiple destinations and departure dates.
- **Data Flow**: The process of scraping HTML, converting it to JSON, and passing it to an LLM was clarified.
- **Docker**: An `entrypoint.sh` script was defined for the Docker container.

Initially, a `config.yaml` was created for search parameters and a `.env` for secrets.

## 2. Configuration Overhaul

The configuration approach was subsequently refactored for simplicity. The YAML configuration was dropped in favor of a single, unified `.env` file to hold both secrets and search parameters. All lists (like destinations) are managed as comma-separated strings.

This involved:
- Merging all parameters into `.env` and `.env.sample`.
- Removing `config.yaml` and `config.yaml.sample`.
- Updating `spec.md` to remove dependencies on `PyYAML` and reflect the new `.env` structure.

## 3. Internationalization

The output language for the AI-generated summaries and reports was changed from **Japanese** to **Chinese**. The Gemini prompt and examples in `spec.md` were updated accordingly.

## 4. Debugging and Data Persistence

A debugging feature was added to the specification. A new `Result Logger` node was added to the agent workflow to save the raw scraped JSON data. These results are saved as timestamped markdown files into a `data/` directory for each search query.

## 5. Scraper Implementation

To begin data collection, a core component of the project was implemented:

- A `scraper.py` script was created to perform the web scraping task.
- The script loads configuration from `.env`, constructs the search URL, uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape `tour.ne.jp`, and saves the parsed data into the `data/` directory, as defined in the specification.

## 6. Generated Artifacts

The following files were created and modified throughout the session:

- **`spec.md`**: The core specification document, which was iteratively updated to reflect all changes.
- **`README.md`**: A user-friendly guide for project setup and usage.
- **`.env` / `.env.sample`**: The unified configuration files.
- **`entrypoint.sh`**: The entrypoint script for the Docker image.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing all Python dependencies.
- **`scraper.py`**: An executable script to perform web scraping.
- **`data/`**: A directory to store scraped results.

## 7. Next Steps

Based on the completed work, the following are the logical next steps to complete the project:

1.  **Build the LangGraph Agent**: Create the main application (`main.py`) and implement the full agent graph as defined in `spec.md`. This involves:
    - Integrating the scraper logic into a dedicated `WebScraper` node.
    - Implementing the `Flight Analyzer` node to call the Gemini API.
    - Implementing the `Telegram Sender` node to dispatch messages.
    - Connecting all nodes in the specified sequence.

2.  **Refine Data Extraction**: Enhance the `parse_flight_data` function in the scraper to extract all the detailed data points (e.g., flight legs, baggage details, all vendors) as outlined in the JSON schema in `spec.md`.

3.  **Full Telegram Bot Integration**: Develop the bot command handlers (`/run`, `/start`) to trigger and interact with the LangGraph agent.

4.  **Dockerize and Test**: Build the Docker image and run the full end-to-end pipeline to test and debug the application in a containerized environment.

5.  **Implement Robust Error Handling**: Add the specified retry logic and fallback mechanisms to make the agent more resilient.
